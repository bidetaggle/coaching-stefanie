Open your Terminal application located in `Applications/Utilities/Terminal` (under mac OS X)

You have to type the commands below in, it's the best way to talk directly to the computer, by the way the command interpreter is called a `shell` üê¢

Then, let's establish the connection and log into the server
```
ssh <username>@<server>
```
Please replace <username> and <server> by the proper values sent in your email.

It gonna ask for a password, type the one in the email. It's normal that you don't see nothing while you type your password, it's a common standard. The original purpose is security, no one reading your screen can see your password's lenght to guess it.
If you see this:
```
Last login: <current date> from <your ip address>
[turtlefox2020@trabit ~]$
```
BAM you're in :)

welcome to Newark, New Jersey, the server is overseas, from now on, please be patient when you type a command, you can feel some latencies due to the long physical distance.
